## Approach
  
### Data understanding & EDA
This stage comprises of two key steps to understand the available data and identify new relevant data in order to solve the business problem.
#### Describe data 
Once you have identified the data set, you need to describe its contents and explore insights to better understand the data and its business implications. To describe the data, we can create a data dictionary that lists down the types of variables (e.g. sectors, company names, etc.), the number of records, and the types of analysis.For describing data learner needs to know one programming language(R ,Python or sas) and excel so that they can easily do first-level analysis and then can create data dictionary.
#### Explore data
To explore data, you can plot simple graphs on Python, e.g. to understand the trend in data or to get a graphical representation of data for better understanding to get useful insights.For exploring data learners needs to know EDA -Exploratory data analysis which could be done with the help of statistics knowledge.
