## Introduction

Coronavirus is caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2(SARS-CoV-2).  It was initially identified in December 2019 in Wuhan, China and resulted in an ongoing worldwide pandemic.  As of July 25 2020, there have been 15.7 million cases reported worldwide and resulted in more than 640,000 deaths. COVID-19 has been especially fatal to individuals with pre-existing health conditions. According to a research study that was looking at diets around the world and their COVID-19 fatalities noted that, “The high rate of consumption of diets high in saturated fats, sugars, and refined carbohydrates (collectively called Western diet, WD) worldwide, contribute to the prevalence of obesity and type 2 diabetes, and could place these populations at an increased risk for severe COVID-19 pathology and mortality”. For this project, our group will be conducting analysis on food consumption and health factors worldwide and see how these factors influence the COVID-19 fatalities. 

## Research Question
How do food consumption and health factors around the world influence COVID-19 fatality rates?

## Approach
  
### Data understanding & EDA
We will start off by reading the dataset into a pandas dataframe. We can then apply various summarizing functions to the data frame such as .info() and .describe(). It is also important to see the distribution of variables and for this we can plot histograms and standardize the dataset if needed. 
#### Describe data 
Once you have identified the data set, you need to describe its contents and explore insights to better understand the data and its business implications. To describe the data, we can create a data dictionary that lists down the types of variables (e.g. sectors, company names, etc.), the number of records, and the types of analysis.For describing data learner needs to know one programming language(R ,Python or sas) and excel so that they can easily do first-level analysis and then can create data dictionary.
#### Explore data
To explore data, you can plot simple graphs on Python, e.g. to understand the trend in data or to get a graphical representation of data for better understanding to get useful insights.For exploring data learners needs to know EDA -Exploratory data analysis which could be done with the help of statistics knowledge.
